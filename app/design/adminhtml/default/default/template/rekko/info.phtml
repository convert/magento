<span class="smashheading">How do I set up "inline content" on Magento?</span><br/>
Inline content is set up by creating an HTML container called a DIV and then assigning the DIV a unique ID. If this sounds too complicated for you and you would like help with your Magento installation - please contact us for more support.

<span class="smashheading">What installation of Rekko is being installed?</span><br/>
Rekko has 2 types of installation. The "Simple" install is only the basic features of Rekko and only requires a simple javascript addition to your website's <head> area. SmashMetrics built this Magento extension specifically to install the much more complicated and feature-rich "Advanced" or "Full" version. Using this extension gives you all of the advanced features available in Rekko's advanced system.
